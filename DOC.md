# cpp-number-heaven documentation
theres like no documentation yet.
what this is is its like two of my projects i want to make it into library or something
it ll allow complex numbers, hypercomplex numbers, dual numbers, split complex numbers etc and maybe even more.
also i kinda dont remember what i did but it was like linkedlist with modulo 1000 as byte so like its more digits than integer limits
both i wanna combine some time later
