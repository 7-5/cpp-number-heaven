# cpp-number-heaven
this is me trying to merge my endlessdigit and hypercomplexnumber projects together.
if you steal i ll get so angry for it i might empty a jar of honey on you. which wouldnt be nice, at least you can get my intention in doing so.
both are my projects and i am summing them into a superproject.
holdon im gonna add some more, i ll be adding my custom defined functions.

heres some [documentation](DOC.md) (nothing there at the moment)

code isnt optimised, this project used to be for personal purposes.
project is cool but meh i feel like abandoning. things are just much i gotta do some other stuff rn in my life
