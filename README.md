# cpp-number-heaven
this is me trying to merge my endlessdigit and hypercomplexnumber projects together.
if you steal i ll get so angry for it i might empty a jar of honey on you. which wouldnt be nice, at least you can get my intention in doing so.
both are my projects and i am summing them into a superproject.
holdon im gonna add some more, i ll be adding my custom defined functions.

heres some [documentation](DOC.md)
